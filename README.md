## Usage

### Individual sections

By default, all sections of the card is available, and you can jump between them in the footer of the card.

However, you can also select individual sections to enable. Use this if you want to show the different sections next to
each other (by adding multiple instances of the card with different sections enabled).

By using the section configuration you can utilise the full power of Home Assistant's layout capabilities and also drag in other cards in your Dashboard view.

### Configuration

Use the Visual Editor in Home Assistant to configure the card. Most options are available there.

### Configuration in YAML

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
entities: # Required unless you specify entityPlatform
  - media_player.kitchen_player
  - media_player.hallway_player
  - media_player.bedroom_player
  - media_player.livingroom_player
excludeItemsInEntitiesList: true # Will invert the selection in the `entities` list, so that all players that are not in the list will be used.
entityPlatform: sonos # will select all entities for this platform. Will override the `entities` list if set.

## Using individual section cards

As mentioned earlier, use the individual sections for more layout flexibility.

Here is an example:

![sections.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/sections.png)
```yaml
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - groups
      - volumes
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - player
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - grouping
      - media browser
```

## Theme variables

The following variables are being used and can be set in your theme to change the appearance of the card:
```
--accent-color
--primary-color
--secondary-text-color
--secondary-background-color
--disabled-text-color
```

Read more about using theme variables here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes

## Custom Favorites

You can add your own buttons to the Favorites section. This can be useful if you want to quickly start a specific radio station or playlist.

To determine what to configure for a button do the following:
1. Start playing the radio station or playlist you want to add. This can for instance be done in this card's media browser or in the built-in Home Assistant Media page.
2. Open the Developer Tools in Home Assistant.
3. Go to the States tab.
4. Find the media player entity that is playing the radio station or playlist.
5. Look for the `media_content_id` and `media_content_type` attributes.
6. For the thumbnail, you can inspect the HTML to see what image the media browser is using, or you can also use a local URL if you have the image stored locally.
7. Use these values to configure the custom favorite.

Example:
![custom_favorites.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/custom_favorites.png)
    
```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
customFavorites: 
  all: # 'all' means it will show for all players, otherwise specify the entity_id of the player.
    - title: BBC
      media_content_id: x-rincon-mp3radio://http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service
      media_content_type: music
      thumbnail: http://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/s24948/images/logoq.jpg?t=1
```

### Finding media_content_id (advanced)

If you want to find the `media_content_id` for a specific radio station or playlist, sometimes the above method is not enough. If so, you can use the following method to find it:
1. Open Media tab
2. Open Chrome Dev Tools
3. Go to Network tab
4. Filter on "WS"
5. Reload page
6. Now you will see a row `websocket`, click on `websocket`
7. Select Messages tab
8. Add filter `play_media`
9. Now navigate to your playlist, and start playing it
10. A line will appear, click on it
11. Expand the JSON object, and look under `service_data`
    There you will see something like:
```
entity_id: "media_player.kok"
media_content_id: "spotify://8fb1de564ba7e4c8c4512361860574c83b9/spotify:playlist:1Oz4xMzRKtRiEs51243ZknqGJm"
media_content_type: "spotify://playlist"
```

![media_content_id.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/media_content_id.png)


## Dynamic volume level slider

The volume level slider is dynamically adjusting its scale. If volume is below 20% it will show a scale up to 30%. Above
20% it will show a scale up to 100%. The color will also change from green to red clearly indicating which scale is
being used.

![dynamic_volumes.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/dynamic_volumes.png)

Enable it in config with `dynamicVolumeSlider: true`

## Linking to specific player

Append `#media_player.my_sonos_player` to page URL to have that player selected.

If `entityId` is configured for the card, the url param will be ignored. See more in the Usage section above.

## Sort order of entities

If you want to have a custom sorting for your entities in the groups section you can use the `entities` configuration. 
Default is otherwise to sort by entity name.

Example:
```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
entities:
  - media_player.sonos_kitchen
  - media_player.sonos_hallway
  - media_player.sonos_bedroom
  - media_player.sonos_livingroom
```

## Device icons

You can configure icons for your devices. This is done under Home Assistant -> Settings -> Entities, select your device then configure the Icon property. If you have configured an icon, it will show in the groups section of the card.
It is recommended to install this one in HACS GitHub - elax46/custom-brand-icons. It has a lot of icons for different devices.

![device_icons.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/device_icons.png)

## CSS Styling

The recommend way to change look and feel is to use the built-in theming capabilities in Home Assistant. If that is not enough this card supports being styled with [card_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod).

Example:

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      color: white !important;
      background: gray;
      --accent-color: pink;
      --primary-color: white;
      --secondary-text-color: white;
      --secondary-background-color: pink;
    }
```

The above YAML renders the following:
