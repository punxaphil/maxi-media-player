## Installation

### HACS

Recommended way of installing this card is with HACS (Home Assistant Community Store).

### Manual

Download the resources, as you would do with all other modules.

Add the custom card as a module, like this:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/maxi-media-player.js?v=1.0
    type: module
```

## Usage

### Individual sections

By default, all sections of the card is available, and you can jump between them in the footer of the card.

However, you can also select individual sections to enable. Use this if you want to show the different sections next to
each other (by adding multiple instances of the card with different sections enabled).

By using the section configuration you can utilise the full power of Home Assistant's layout capabilities and also drag
in other cards in your Dashboard view.

### Configuration

Use the Visual Editor in Home Assistant to configure the card. Most options are available there.

## Using individual section cards

As mentioned earlier, use the individual sections for more layout flexibility.

Here is an example:

![sections.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/sections.png)
```yaml
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - groups
      - volumes
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - player
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - grouping
      - media browser
```

## Theme variables

The following variables are being used and can be set in your theme to change the appearance of the card:
```
--accent-color
--primary-color
--secondary-text-color
--secondary-background-color
--disabled-text-color
```

Read more about using theme variables here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes

## CSS Styling

The recommend way to change look and feel is to use the built-in theming capabilities in Home Assistant. If that is not enough this card supports being styled with [card_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod).

Example:

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      color: white !important;
      background: gray;
      --accent-color: pink;
      --primary-color: white;
      --secondary-text-color: white;
      --secondary-background-color: pink;
    }
```

The above YAML renders the following:

![styling.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/styling.png)

## Dynamic volume level slider

The volume level slider is dynamically adjusting its scale. If volume is below 20% it will show a scale up to 30%. Above
20% it will show a scale up to 100%. The color will also change from green to red clearly indicating which scale is
being used.

![dynamic_volumes.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/dynamic_volumes.png)

Enable it in config with `dynamicVolumeSlider: true`

## Linking to specific player

Append `#media_player.my_player` to page URL to have that player selected.

If `entityId` is configured for the card, the url param will be ignored. See more in the Usage section above.
