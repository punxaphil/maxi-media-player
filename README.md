# Maxi Media Player

Maxi Media Player for Home Assistant UI with a focus on managing multiple media players!

This card, Maxi Media Player, is a generalisation of the [Sonos Card](https://github.com/punxaphil/custom-sonos-card), and its aim is to work with all media players supported by Home Assistant. In contrast to the Sonos Card, it will not automatically discover your media players, but you will have to specify which ones to use in the configuration. 

## Features:

- Group/Ungroup speakers
- Control multiple speakers
- Play favorites from list
- Favorites section
- Control individual volumes in a group
- Artwork background
- Possibility to override artwork
- Shuffle and repeat mode
- Theming
- Configurable styling
- Dynamic volume level slider
- Track progress bar
- Show, play and rearrange tracks in play queue (Sonos and Music Assistant)
- Set and clear sleep timer (Sonos)
- Search for music via Music Assistant

and more!

## Usage

### Individual sections

By default, all sections of the card is available, and you can jump between them in the footer of the card.

However, you can also select individual sections to enable. Use this if you want to show the different sections next to
each other (by adding multiple instances of the card with different sections enabled).

By using the section configuration you can utilise the full power of Home Assistant's layout capabilities and also drag in other cards in your Dashboard view.

```yaml
sections: # Choose which sections to show in the card. Available sections are:
  - volumes
  - groups
  - grouping
  - media browser
  - player
  - queue # Sonos or Music Assistant
  - search # Music Assistant
```

### Configuration

Use the Visual Editor in Home Assistant to configure the card. Most options are available there.

## Using individual section cards

As mentioned earlier, use the individual sections for more layout flexibility.

Here is an example:

![sections.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/sections.png)

```yaml
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - groups
      - volumes
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - player
  - type: custom:maxi-media-player
    sections:
      - grouping
      - media browser
```

## Theme variables

The following variables are being used and can be set in your theme to change the appearance of the card:

```
--accent-color
--primary-color
--secondary-text-color
--secondary-background-color
--disabled-text-color
```

Read more about using theme variables here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes

## Blurred background

Create a modern look by using a blurred version of the album artwork as background. The normal artwork is displayed on top, and the header/controls have a semi-transparent background.

![blur.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/blur.png)

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
player:
  artworkAsBackgroundBlur: 10
  controlsAndHeaderBackgroundOpacity: 0.7
```

## Slim version

This example will give a slimmer version of the card.

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
heightPercentage: 60
player:
  showVolumeUpAndDownButtons: true
  hideArtwork: true
  controlsLargeIcons: true
mediaBrowser:
  itemsPerRow: 6
  hideHeader: true
groups:
  compact: true
grouping:
  compact: true
footerHeight: 3.5
```

![slim.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/slim.png)
![slim_2.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/slim_2.png)

## Custom Favorites

You can add your own buttons to the Favorites section. This can be useful if you want to quickly start a specific radio station or playlist.

To determine what to configure for a button do the following:

1. Start playing the radio station or playlist you want to add. This can for instance be done in this card's favorites section or in the built-in Home Assistant Media page.
2. Open the Developer Tools in Home Assistant.
3. Go to the States tab.
4. Find the media player entity that is playing the radio station or playlist.
5. Look for the `media_content_id` and `media_content_type` attributes.
6. For the thumbnail, you can inspect the HTML to see what image the favorites section is using, or you can also use a local URL if you have the image stored locally.
7. Use these values to configure the custom favorite.

Example:
![custom_favorites.png](https://github.com/punxaphil/maxi-media-player/raw/main/img/custom_favorites.png)

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
mediaBrowser:
  favorites:
    customFavorites:
      all: # 'all' means it will show for all players, otherwise specify the entity_id of the player.
        - title: BBC
          media_content_id: x-rincon-mp3radio://http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service
          media_content_type: music
          thumbnail: http://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/s24948/images/logoq.jpg?t=1
```

### Finding media_content_id (advanced)

If you want to find the `media_content_id` for a specific radio station, playlist, or media browser folder, sometimes the above method is not enough. If so, you can use the following method to find it:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Filter by **WS** (WebSocket)
4. Reload the page
5. Click on the `websocket` connection that appears
6. Go to the **Messages** tab
7. Filter messages by:
   - `play_media` - for finding content to play (custom favorites)
   - `browse_media` - for finding folder paths (media browser shortcuts)
8. Navigate to your playlist/folder and start playing it or click on it
9. A message will appear - click on it and expand the JSON object
10. Look for `media_content_id` and `media_content_type` in the data

Example for a playable item (custom favorite):
```json
{
  "service_data": {
    "entity_id": "media_player.living_room",
    "media_content_id": "spotify://playlist:1Oz4xMzRKtRiEs51243ZknqGJm",
    "media_content_type": "spotify://playlist"
  }
}
```

Example for a folder (media browser shortcut):
```json
{
  "type": "media_player/browse_media",
  "entity_id": "media_player.living_room",
  "media_content_id": "spotify://8fb1de564ba7e4c8c4561860574c83b9",
  "media_content_type": "spotify://library"
}
```

## Media Browser Shortcut

You can configure a shortcut button in the media browser header that takes you directly to a specific folder. This is especially useful for wall-mounted touch displays where you want quick access to frequently used folders like Spotify playlists.

### Example configuration

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
mediaBrowser:
  shortcut:
    media_content_id: 'spotify://8fb1de564ba7e4c8c4561860574c83b9'
    media_content_type: 'spotify://library'
    icon: 'mdi:spotify'
    name: 'My Spotify'
```

The shortcut button will appear in the media browser header (both in Favorites and Browse Media views), to the left of the other navigation icons. Clicking it will navigate directly to the specified folder, reducing multiple taps to just one.

## Dynamic volume level slider

The volume level slider is dynamically adjusting its scale. If volume is below 20% it will show a scale up to 30%. Above
20% it will show a scale up to 100%. The color will also change from green to red clearly indicating which scale is
being used.

Enable it in config with `dynamicVolumeSlider: true`

## Linking and Player Persistence

By default, you can append a player in URL hash (e.g. `#media_player.my_sonos_player`) to have that player selected.
You can change this behavior to use the browser's session storage by setting `storePlayerInSessionStorage: true`. This prevents the URL from changing when you select a player.

If `entityId` is configured for the card, both the URL hash and session storage will be ignored on initial load. See more in the Usage section above.

If you never want to remember the selected player, you can set `doNotRememberSelectedPlayer: true` to an empty string.

## Sort order of entities

If you want to have a custom sorting for your entities in the groups section you can use the `entities` configuration.
Default is otherwise to sort by entity name.

Example:

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
entities:
  - media_player.sonos_kitchen
  - media_player.sonos_hallway
  - media_player.sonos_bedroom
  - media_player.sonos_livingroom
```

## Device icons

You can configure icons for your devices. This is done under Home Assistant -> Settings -> Entities, select your device then configure the Icon property. If you have configured an icon, it will show in the groups section of the card.
It is recommended to install this one in HACS GitHub - elax46/custom-brand-icons. It has a lot of icons for different devices.

## CSS Styling

The recommend way to change look and feel is to use the built-in theming capabilities in Home Assistant, or use an already existing config option for this card (see Config section above). If that is not enough this card supports being styled with [card_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod).

Example:

```yaml
type: custom:maxi-media-player
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      color: white !important;
      background: gray;
      --accent-color: pink;
      --primary-color: white;
      --secondary-text-color: white;
      --secondary-background-color: pink;
    }
```

The above YAML renders the following:

Here is another example of changing the position of the artwork in the player section:

```yaml
heightPercentage: auto
card_mod:
  style:
    mxmp-player$: |
      .container {        
        grid-template-areas:
            'header artwork'
            'controls artwork' !important;
        grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr !important;
      }
```
